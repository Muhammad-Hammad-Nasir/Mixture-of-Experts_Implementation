# Mixture-of-Experts_Implementation

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. MoE is a powerful machine learning architecture that dynamically selects subsets of expert models (or neural networks) to process different parts of the input, allowing for efficient and specialized learning. This approach is particularly useful for handling diverse tasks and large-scale data.
